## Basic Realm App Template

This is a repository that holds a very simple realm app

The structure of this repository will emulate that of the final template apps to come

## Local Setup

1. Create a new realm app in whatever environment you're working in (local, dev, qa, staging, prod)
2. Create a new file called `realm_config.json` in `reactjs/src/utils/`
3. Copy and paste the following snippet into this newly created `realm_config.json` file

```json
{
  "app_id": "<paste your app id here>",
  "url": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```
